This is an example of me practicing express.
I made comments above each important line/block of code in order to better understand what I was doing.
I made comments as if I was teaching the code I was writting or as if I was talking to my future self. 
This is a good example of how I code. I usually pseudocode out loud or write out pseudocode in comments.
I am also very incrimental when I code. I do this to avoid mistakes and bugs.
